### The computation that we are going to be doing for our project will be computing the Lucas number.

### Number of threads we are using for our computation coordinator: 5

### Our old computation took 25ms and our new computation took 2ms 

### The main fix that we thought to do was to approach the problem differently. We implemented dynamic programming to get a much faster time to compute the Lucas number of the given output.
