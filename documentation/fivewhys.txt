Problem: We are trying to get our computation engine on a website, but it's not working.

1st Why: Why isn't it working?
    - The transition of our computation engine into a website isn't working because our build.gradle file isn't detecting some necessary plugins

2nd Why: Why?
    - We did not catch, nor fix the problems in our code early on or try to understand them better and Gradle is new to all of us.

3rd Why: Why weren't the problems caught in the code early on?
    - We waited until the time of the deadline neared to come up with a solution for the code.

4th why: Why did you wait until the last minute to catch on to the problems in the code?
    - No plan was previously created to speed the process up and avoid problems with the amount of time there was remaining.

5th why: Why was there no plan previously created to prevent time management issues within the group?
    - Poor communication between group members.

Process Change:

    In order for these problems, especially within our communication, to be addressed, there needs to be more focus 
    on fixing the previous assignments as soon as possible, while also coming up with a concise and detailed plan
    within the group for the next assignment. This way, we can complete assignments in a sequential order without having 
    to sacrifice previous work that could come back and potentially haunt our workflow in the future.
